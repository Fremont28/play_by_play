NBA shot charts 

Below is a recap of some metrics and visualizations of shot attempts by players and teams during the 2014-2015 NBA season.

In our previous article,Â we built random forest and logistic regression models predicting whether a shot was made or not based on the time of possession, shot distance, and the previous play (i.e. missed shot, turnover, timeout).

Outside of these models, however, it is probably more useful to quantify shot patterns on a player and team level.

Visualizing possession time and shot distance allows us to explore how teams value different shot types (i.e. three-pointer versus a mid-range jumper) and the shot clock. For example, a team built around power forwards and centers might tend to cluster shots around the basket and draw out the length of a possession whereas a fast tempo small-ball lineup would probably look to spread the court and create quick shots. Of course, the opposite could also be true particularly with today's hybrid-small ball lineup teams.
